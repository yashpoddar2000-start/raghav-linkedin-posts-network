Chick-fil-A has breakfast, salads, wraps, grilled chicken, kids meals, catering. KFC has 11 different chicken options. Popeyes has 8. Raising Cane's has chicken fingers. That's it.

Chick-fil-A: $7.5M per store.
Raising Cane's: $6.6M per store.
Fast-food average: ~$3M per store.

One menu item. Double the industry average revenue.

Here's what that constraint created:

Most big QSR chains are 80-95% franchised. They push capex and volatility to franchisees, clip high-margin royalties.

Raising Cane's is overwhelmingly company-owned in the U.S. They don't offer standard franchise opportunities.

They're making ~21% EBITDA margins while owning almost every restaurant themselves.

How?

System sales tripled in five years to $5.1B.
Revenue per store up 74% over that period.
Same-store sales grew 17.5% in the first half of 2024.

All while opening 118 new stores in 2024.

Most chains see margin compression during hyper-growth. Pre-opening costs. Training inefficiencies. Immature units diluting performance.

Cane's grew sales >30% annually for five years and still maintained 21.7% profit margins.

The focused menu enables it:

One protein. Same fryer temperature. Same cook time. Minimal changeovers.

StarTribune reports meals ready in ~2:30. That's batch cooking at scale.

70% of their $5.1B flows through drive-thru. They average 370 seconds per car—slower than most peers. But when every order is a variant of the same thing, you can batch produce. Volume beats seconds.

That operational simplicity scales:

Adding a new Raising Cane's location means copying the exact same playbook. Same equipment. Same training. Same supply chain.

The $6.6M per store makes the math work:

At ~21% profit margin, that's roughly $1.2-1.4M profit per store.

828 restaurants × $1.3M profit = ~$1.1B in total operating profit.

All flowing to one owner.

KFC needed thousands of locations and menu diversity to reach $5B in sales.
Cane's did it with under 1,000 stores selling one thing.

But here's the risk:

Company ownership means no franchise buffer. Chicken price spikes hit directly. Labor increases flow straight through. The model that captures 100% of upside also absorbs 100% of volatility.

Yet the revenue per store and profit margins are strong enough to absorb it.

Cane's now ranks #3 in chicken, surpassing KFC with a fraction of the locations.

They refused breakfast expansion. Rejected menu creep. Ignored the pressure to add wraps, salads, bone-in options.

That discipline cost them daypart revenue and variety-seeking customers.

It bought them the right to run $6.6M stores with ~21% profit margins, keeping every dollar of restaurant-level profit.

950+ locations by late 2025. All selling the same thing.

The constraint is the strategy.
