Subway closed 7,601 U.S. locations in a decade. That's more than Taco Bell's entire U.S. footprint. More than Domino's. More than Pizza Hut.

Yet Subway still has 19,502 U.S. stores: the most of any restaurant chain in America.

Subway built 27,000+ U.S. stores on a low-barrier model. $15,000 franchise fee. Minimal investment.

$9.5B U.S. sales ÷ 19,502 stores = ~$490K per location.

12.5% in fees (8% royalty + 4.5% advertising) = ~$61K straight off the top.

Margins at 15-22% = $73K-$108K profit. Many stores fall below.

Subway: $490K revenue, 12.5% fees → $75-100K profit
Jimmy John's: $1M revenue, 6% fees
Sonic: $2M revenue, 5-6% fees

Similar profit. 2-4x the revenue.

Low initial cost. Permanent 12.5% fees on weak revenue.

Only ~10% have drive-thrus. Revenue capped.

Mandatory redesigns and equipment: $50K-$100K+ reinvestment on $75K profit.

The overbuild:

27,000+ stores built. 7,601 closed. 19,502 left. Market share fell 21%.

Revenue per store up 19%. Total sales down 5%.

System still oversaturated.

Subway is three businesses:

Non-traditional units: growing 13%.
International: adding 1,000+ stores annually.
U.S. strip malls: oversaturated.

Digital is ~35% of sales but adds labor strain without drive-thrus.

The model works where labor and rent are cheap.

Subway didn't turn around: it made the survivors less bad.

The model works in convenience stores, airports, and emerging markets—anywhere labor and rent are cheap.

In overbuilt U.S. strip malls, 19% revenue growth is damage control, not a fix.
