DECISION #1:
   Agent: davidPark
   Rationale: David is best suited to explore the strategic rationale and mechanisms behind Chipotle's franchise strategy. His expertise will help uncover the 'why' and 'how' of their approach, which is crucial for creating compelling content. Alex and Maya are not selected at this stage because we first need to understand the strategic insights before diving into data or economic analysis.
   Instruction: Investigate Chipotle's franchise strategy. Focus on understanding why Chipotle has chosen its specific approach to franchising, including any strategic rationale and mechanisms behind their decision. Look for insights that reveal surprising aspects of their strategy that might not be widely known.
