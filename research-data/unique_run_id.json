      "Chipotle's decision to own rather than franchise 3,726 restaurants is a $1.2 billion bet on control.\n\nWhy?\n\n• Owned Model: Operating Income: $1.916 billion, Margin: 13.56%\n• Franchised Model: Revenue: $949.5 million, Operating Income: ~$700 million, Margin: 77%\n\nThe result? A $1.2 billion gap in operating income.\n\nThe mechanism: Absolute cash flow trumps margin percentage for shareholder returns. Chipotle's strong cash flow and high ROIC negate the need for franchising.\n\nThe lesson: When you're capital-rich, franchising is giving away your best stores.\n\nWhat business model rules is your industry following blindly?"
