The chain closed 631 locations in the U.S., continuing a trend of shrinking outlets and falling below 20,000 stores in the U.S. for the first time in two decades. ([ksby.com](https://www.ksby.com/business/subway-closed-more-locations-in-2024-continuing-years-of-us-decline), [cnn.com](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/01/food/subway-closures)) However, Subway experienced positive global net restaurant growth for the second straight year, opening over 1,000 new locations worldwide. ([qsrmagazine.com](https://www.qsrmagazine.com/story/subway-stays-in-growth-mode-thanks-to-international-expansion)) The brand is focused on international expansion, with plans to double the number of new restaurant openings in 2024 compared to 2019.

Subway's target market includes the general population, with a primary age range between 16 and 30 years old, but also caters to children, families, and older adults seeking healthier options ([Building H](https://www.buildingh.org/index/2024/profiles/subway), [Marketing Scoop](https://www.marketingscoop.com/consumer/subway-target-market)). The company aims to cater to both male and female customers and attracts individuals with middle-class incomes, though it also appeals to those with higher and lower incomes ([Marketing Scoop](https://www.marketingscoop.com/consumer/subway-target-market)).\n [Source: Building H Index 2024 - Subway](https://www.buildingh.org/index/2024/profiles/subway)\n\nQ: What loyalty programs did Subway offer in 2024?\nA: In December 2025, Subway offered the Sub Club loyalty program, which gives customers a free footlong sandwich after purchasing three footlongs or six 6-inch subs.

Subway's competitive strategy focuses on differentiation through product characteristics like freshness and customization, positioning itself as a healthier alternative to traditional fast-food chains ([Restroworks](https://www.restroworks.com/blog/subway-restaurant-marketing-strategy)). However, Subway faces competition from major fast-food chains like McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's, as well as fast-casual chains like Jimmy John's ([Bstrategyhub](https://bstrategyhub.com/subway-competitors-and-alternatives), [Swotwizard](https://swotwizard.com/subway-swot-analysis)). Subway's primary competitive strategy is cost leadership, achieved through standardization and economies of scale, and its secondary strategy is differentiation ([Panmore](https://panmore.com/subway-generic-competitive-strategy-intensive-growth-strategies-case-study)). In November 2024, 24% of consumers named Subway as the best deli sandwich option ([Yougov](https://yougov.com/en-us/articles/51913-the-battle-of-the-subs-which-chain-reigns-supreme)).\n [Source: The battle of the subs: Which chain reigns supreme? - YouGov](https://yougov.com/en-us/articles/51913-the-battle-of-the-subs-which-chain-reigns-supreme)\n\n══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\n## SECTION 2: DEEP RESEARCH (3 Strategic Reports)\n\n## DEEP RESEARCH REPORT 1\n\n# Subway's Operational Strategies (2022-2024)\n\n## 1. Digital Sales Integration and Impact on Operations\n\nSubway experienced a significant surge in digital sales from 2022 to 2024, with digital revenue tripling since 2019 and reaching approximately $3.9 billion by 2025. This accounted for about 35% of total sales, reflecting a strategic shift towards digital channels ([QSR Magazine, 2024](https://www.qsrmagazine.com/story/the-2025-qsr-50-fast-foods-leading-annual-report)). The growth was driven by initiatives such as the launch of \"Fresh Forward 2.0,\" which incorporated self-serve kiosks, digital order screens, and a revamped loyalty program, all aimed at enhancing customer experience and operational efficiency ([Subway Newsroom, 2024](https://newsroom.subway.com/2024-11-12-Subway-Unveils-New-Global-Restaurant-Design)).\n\nSubcontracting digital infrastructure support to Capgemini further exemplifies Subway’s focus on digital transformation, enabling faster service and personalized customer interactions ([Capgemini, 2024](https://www.consulting.us/news/10137/capgemini-supports-subway-on-large-scale-digital-update)). These efforts contributed to positive same-store sales growth, with some reports citing double-digit increases in digital sales, which helped offset challenges from market saturation and store closures ([QSR Magazine, 2024](https://www.qsrmagazine.com/growth/fast-casual/fast-food-trends-for-2024-the-age-of-automation-and-customer-experience)).\n\n## 2. Menu Innovation and Operational Efficiency\n\nBetween 2022 and 2024, Subway introduced 'Footlong Sidekicks,' a line of snack-sized footlong items such as cookies, pretzels, and churros. Launched in early 2024, these items aimed to meet consumer demand for snackable, flavorful options and convenience ([Subway Newsroom](https://newsroom.subway.com/Subway-Sidekicks), [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2024/06/18/subway-footlong-dippers-sidekicks-menu/74136886007)). The new offerings reportedly exceeded sales expectations, indicating strong customer interest.\n\nOperationally, the introduction of standardized, smaller menu items likely streamlined kitchen processes by simplifying preparation and reducing complexity. This could have led to faster service during peak hours, increased throughput, and improved table turnover. While menu diversification required staff training and inventory adjustments, these changes potentially resulted in long-term efficiencies and better resource management ([Industry report](https://rezku.com/blog/qsr-industry)).\n\nCustomer retention was positively impacted as these innovations aligned with broader trends toward health-conscious, convenient, and flavorful food options. Digital marketing campaigns and targeted promotions around the new menu items further enhanced customer engagement and loyalty ([QSR Magazine, 2024](https://www.qsrmagazine.com/growth/finance/the-2024-qsr-50-fast-foods-leading-annual-report)).\n\n## 3. Cost Management Strategies and Operational Resilience\n\nSpecific details on Subway’s cost management strategies from 2022-2024 are limited within the gathered sources. However, the focus on menu standardization, digital integration, and operational streamlining suggests that cost control was a key component of their resilience. Standardized menu items reduce inventory complexity and waste, while digital tools improve order accuracy and labor efficiency, collectively contributing to cost savings and operational stability.\n\nDespite the closure of 7,601 units, Subway’s strategic emphasis on digital sales growth and menu innovation likely helped sustain overall revenue and market presence. These mechanisms enabled the brand to adapt to market challenges, maintain customer engagement, and optimize operational costs.\n\n## 4. Summary of Key Operational Mechanisms\n\n- **Digital Transformation:** Subway’s aggressive digital initiatives, including self-serve kiosks, mobile app enhancements, and strategic partnerships, significantly contributed to sales growth and operational efficiency.\n- **Menu Innovation:** The introduction of snackable, standardized items like 'Footlong Sidekicks' improved kitchen throughput, reduced complexity, and attracted a broader customer base.\n- **Operational Efficiency:** Emphasis on digital tools and menu standardization helped streamline operations, reduce waste, and improve service speed.\n- **Resilience Amid Closures:** While specific strategies to counteract store closures are not detailed, the combined effect of digital growth and menu innovation provided a foundation for maintaining market leadership.\n\nThese mechanisms collectively underpin Subway’s ability to sustain its position as the largest restaurant brand despite significant unit closures, demonstrating adaptability through technological and menu-driven innovations.\n\n══════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\n## DEEP RESEARCH REPORT 2\n\n# Subway Franchise Model and Competitive Analysis\n\n## Economic Structure and Resilience of Subway\n\nSubway's franchise model is characterized by a low initial franchise fee of approximately $15,000 and a consistent royalty rate of 8% of gross sales, complemented by a 4.5% advertising fee, totaling around 12.5% in ongoing costs ([Franchise Chatter](https://www.franchisechatter.com/2021/12/17/subways-initial-franchise-fee-royalty-fee-41-other-fees), [Subway Franchise](https://www.subwayfranchise.com/en-us/faqs)). Despite the recent closure of over 600 US locations in 2024, reducing the domestic footprint below 20,000 stores, Subway's international expansion and diversification of store formats have contributed to its resilience. The company has strategically shifted towards non-traditional venues and drive-thrus, which have helped offset domestic declines ([QSR Magazine](https://www.qsrmagazine.com/food/sandwiches/subways-global-growth-strategy-expands-its-horizons), [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/subway-closures-us-stores-for-first-time-in-20-years-2025)). This global focus and store format flexibility have maintained overall brand relevance and operational stability.\n\n## Franchisee Profitability in 2024\n\nIndustry estimates indicate that Subway franchisees achieve average annual revenues of approximately $490,000, with profit margins ranging from 15% to 22%. This translates to net profits of roughly $73,500 to $107,800 per unit annually, although actual margins vary based on location, management, and operational efficiency ([Restaurant Business Online](https://restaurantbusinessonline.com/financing/subway-closed-more-restaurants-last-year), [Biz2Credit](https://www.biz2credit.com/franchise-loans/how-much-cost-start-subway-franchise)). Top-performing franchisees can generate over $30,000 to $40,000 in cash flow annually, representing about 7% of sales, but profitability is sensitive to ongoing costs such as royalties and advertising fees ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FStlBGSX4mY), [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Is-the-Subway-franchise-profit-worth-the-cost)).\n\n## Impact of Franchise Fees and Royalties\n\nThe initial franchise fee of $15,000 lowers entry barriers, encouraging new franchisees. However, the ongoing royalty fee of 8% of gross sales, combined with a 4.5% advertising fee, imposes significant financial burdens that can erode profit margins. For example, with an AUV of $490,000, the royalty alone amounts to approximately $39,200 annually. When combined with other operational costs, these fees can substantially reduce net profitability, especially in markets with lower sales or higher operational costs. This fee structure influences franchisee economics by constraining profit margins and potentially affecting franchisee sustainability, particularly amid declining store counts and operational challenges ([Franchise Times](https://www.franchisetimes.com/franchise_legal/subway-franchisees-continue-to-fight-remodel-mandate)).\n\n## Comparative Analysis with Key Competitors\n\n### Sonic Drive-In\n- **Initial Investment:** $1.7 million to $3.37 million ([Sonic FDD](https://sonicfranchising.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sonic-05-2023-Amended-FDD)).\n- **Franchise Fee:** Approximately $45,000.\n- **Royalty Rate:** 5-6% of gross sales.\n- **Profitability:** High AUVs (~$2 million) with profit margins around 10-12%, driven by high traffic and operational efficiency.\n\n### Jimmy John’s\n- **Initial Investment:** $300,000 to $1 million ([Jimmy John’s FDD](https://www.jimmyjohnsfranchising.com)).\n- **Franchise Fee:** About $35,000.\n- **Royalty Rate:** 6% of gross sales.\n- **Profitability:** AUVs around $1 million, with profit margins estimated at 10-15%, supported by strong brand loyalty and operational control.\n\n### Chick-fil-A\n- **Initial Investment:** Often exceeds $1 million, with a franchise fee of $10,000 ([Chick-fil-A FDD](https://www.franchisetimes.com/app/Chick-fil-A%20Zee.pdf)).\n- **Royalty Rate:** 15% of sales, but with high sales volumes.\n- **Profitability:** High AUVs and profit margins, with some franchisees reporting net profits exceeding $200,000 annually, supported by high brand loyalty and operational support.\n\n## Summary\n\nWhile Subway's low initial franchise fee and steady sales figures support its broad franchise base, the high ongoing royalty and advertising fees significantly impact franchisee profitability. Competitors like Sonic and Jimmy John’s operate with higher initial investments but benefit from higher AUVs and profit margins, driven by different operational models and market positioning. Chick-fil-A, with its high sales volume and profit margins, exemplifies a premium franchise model with substantial profitability potential. Overall, Subway's franchise economics are challenged by fee structures and market dynamics, influencing long-term sustainability and competitive positioning within the fast-food sandwich sector.\n\n══════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\n## DEEP RESEARCH REPORT 3\n\n# Subway's Strategic Positioning, Brand Differentiation, Expansion, Industry Trends, and Competitive Responses (2022-2024)\n\n## 1. Strategic Positioning and Brand Differentiation\n\nSubway has undergone a strategic transformation aimed at revitalizing its brand and expanding its global footprint despite significant domestic unit closures. The company has focused on modernizing its restaurant experience through initiatives like the 'Fresh Forward' redesign and global design updates, which aim to enhance customer engagement and operational efficiency ([Subway Newsroom, 2024](https://newsroom.subway.com/2024-11-12-Subway-Unveils-New-Global-Restaurant-Design)). This repositioning aligns with a broader strategy to shift from a primarily domestic chain to a global brand with a diversified portfolio.\n\nBrand differentiation has been reinforced through campaigns emphasizing freshness and health, such as the 'Eat Fresh. Feel Good.' platform, which leverages emotional appeal and health-conscious messaging ([Subway Newsroom, 2024](https://apac.newsroom.subway.com/SUBWAY-R-UNWRAPS-FRESH-NEW-BRAND-PLATFORM-VIA-SUB-HOPPERS-CAMPAIGN)). Additionally, Subway has adapted its menu to local tastes, such as removing pork in Israel, demonstrating cultural sensitivity and flexibility that strengthen its global appeal ([Digication, 2024](https://cunyonline.digication.com/VJ_SUBWAY/The_Global_Expansion_of_Subway_Sandwich_Shops)). The brand emphasizes customization, freshness, and affordability, positioning itself as a healthier, value-oriented alternative in the crowded QSR market ([RestroWorks, 2024](https://www.restroworks.com/blog/subway-restaurant-marketing-strategy)).\n\nMarketing efforts have incorporated digital innovations, including 3D billboards and social media campaigns, to modernize its image and attract younger demographics ([Whatever Digital Media, 2024](https://whateverdigitalmedia.wordpress.com/2024/05/12/subways-use-of-digital-campaigns)). Sponsorships, such as NFL commercials, further enhance visibility and brand relevance ([iSpot, 2024](https://www.ispot.tv/ad/fvo0/subway-fiery-meatball-sub-nfl-2024-longest-runs)).\n\n## 2. Expansion Strategy and International Growth\n\nSubway's expansion strategy from 2022 to 2024 has been characterized by aggressive international growth and a focus on non-traditional locations. As of 2024, Subway committed to over 10,000 new restaurants globally, including new markets like Paraguay and Mongolia, and signed seven master franchise agreements, reflecting a strategic push into emerging markets ([Subway Newsroom, 2024](https://newsroom.subway.com/2024-10-01-Subway-Continues-to-Expand-Its-Global-Presence-with-Over-10,000-Future-Restaurant-Commitments)).\n\nIn 2023, Subway operated in over 102 countries with more than 37,000 locations, with international markets accounting for approximately 40% of new openings in 2024 ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subway_(restaurant))). This international focus is driven by the potential for higher growth rates and diversification away from saturated U.S. markets.\n\nNon-traditional locations have become a key component of Subway’s expansion, with about 5,900 such venues in the U.S. and Canada in 2022, representing roughly a quarter of its footprint in those regions. These venues include airports, hospitals, gas stations, and convenience stores, which have shown a 13% increase in same-store sales by 2024, indicating profitability and strategic importance ([QSR Magazine, 2022](https://www.qsrmagazine.com/uncategorized/subways-investment-non-traditional-locations-pays)).\n\n## 3. Industry Trends and Competitive Responses\n\nThe global QSR industry from 2022 to 2024 has been shaped by several key trends. Consumer preferences increasingly favor value, convenience, and health-conscious options, prompting chains to innovate with meal deals, loyalty programs, and healthier menu items like plant-based options ([QSR Magazine, 2024](https://www.qsrmagazine.com/story/the-2025-qsr-50-fast-foods-leading-annual-report)).\n\nTechnological advancements have been pivotal, with widespread adoption of mobile ordering, contactless payments, AI-driven personalization, and automation in kitchens and drive-thrus. These innovations aim to improve speed, accuracy, and operational efficiency, although some initial glitches have been reported ([Zappi, 2025](https://www.zappi.io/web/blog/qsr-trends)).\n\nSustainability initiatives have gained prominence, with chains adopting eco-friendly practices such as biodegradable packaging, waste reduction, and sourcing locally. Transparency in sourcing and carbon footprint reduction are increasingly influencing consumer loyalty and brand reputation ([Forbes, 2024](https://www.forbes.com/sites/garyocchiogrosso/2024/01/20/trends-shaping-the-ever-changing-restaurant-business-in-2024)).\n\nMajor competitors like McDonald's, Starbucks, and Yum! Brands continue to expand aggressively through digital channels and delivery services. McDonald's, in particular, leads with innovations in automation and menu diversification, challenging Subway’s market share. New entrants like Chipotle and Jersey Mike's are also gaining ground by emphasizing health and sustainability, forcing Subway to innovate further ([Market Data Forecast, 2024](https://www.marketdataforecast.com/market-reports/fast-food-market)).\n\n## 4. Future Outlook and Strategic Recommendations\n\nThe industry is projected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 5.2% from 2022 to 2032, reaching an estimated USD 320.7 billion.
