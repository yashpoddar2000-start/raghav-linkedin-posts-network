  "text": "DoorDash tripled market share in 5 years. Uber Eats stayed flat.\n\nDoorDash launched DashPass in 2018. $9.99/month. Unlimited delivery.\n\nUber launched Uber One in 2024. 6 years late.\n\n6 years behind = fighting established habits. $9.99/month × 60 months = $600 lifetime value already captured.\n\nExecution:\n\nDoorDash: 95% on-time, 26-minute delivery, advanced routing, order batching.\n\nUber Eats: 30-minute delivery, drivers switching between rides/food/grocery, multi-vertical resource allocation.\n\nDoorDash drivers deliver food. Uber drivers deliver everything. Focus dilutes.\n\nRestaurant exclusivity:\n\nDoorDash (2014-2020):\n• Exclusive agreements with suburban restaurant chains\n• Connected to restaurant ordering systems within one week\n• Locked competitors out\n\nUber Eats:\n• Urban restaurant focus\n• No aggressive suburban exclusivity\n• Leveraged ride-sharing relationships\n\nExclusive deals = locked out. Can't deliver from restaurants under contract.\n\nGeographic sequencing:\n\nPhase 1 (2014-2018): DoorDash dominated urban markets. SF, LA, NYC, Chicago. Beat Grubhub and Uber.\n\nPhase 2 (2018-2020): Expanded to suburbs with exclusivity deals. Uber didn't follow aggressively.\n\nUrban economics work better: shorter routes, higher density. But DoorDash won both. Uber only competed urban.\n\nStrategic constraints:\n\nUber: $20B ride-sharing + $12.5B grocery + food delivery = three priorities competing for driver time.\n\nDoorDash: Food delivery = only priority. All resources optimized for one business.\n\nPure-play beats diversified.\n\nQ3 2024:\n• DoorDash: $2.7B revenue, first profitable year, 24% growth\n• Uber Eats: $3.5B revenue, 4.1% margin, 13% growth\n\nMore revenue ≠ more profit when your model splits resources across three businesses.\n\nThe compounding loop:\n\nDashPass (2018) → customer lock-in → higher order frequency → better restaurant deals → exclusive agreements → suburban dominance → 95% on-time rate → more customers.\n\nUber's 2024 subscription launch fights this with same price, weaker metrics (30 min vs 26 min), no exclusive access.\n\n2024: DoorDash 60.7%, Uber Eats 23%.",
