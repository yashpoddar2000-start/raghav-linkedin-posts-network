Taco Bell makes $550,000 profit per store. Pizza Hut makes $147,000.

Same parent company. 3.7x profit gap.

Pizza Hut: 19,000 stores globally. Taco Bell: 8,800. Yet Taco Bell generates more operating profit within Yum! Brands.

Why:

Taco Bell:
• $2.2M revenue/store
• 24% margin
• $550K profit

Pizza Hut:
• $980K revenue/store
• 15% effective margin
• $147K profit

The core issue is fixed costs.

Pizza Hut operates 6,000-7,000 sq ft dine-in restaurants. Taco Bell operates 2,500 sq ft drive-thru boxes.

Pizza Hut location (mid-market strip-center):
• Rent: $227K annually (6,500 sq ft × $35)
• 23% occupancy cost on $980K revenue
• Labor: 30-32% (dine-in service + kitchen)

Taco Bell location (pad-site):
• Rent: $100K annually (2,500 sq ft × $40)
• 4.5% occupancy cost on $2.2M revenue
• Labor: 25-27% (drive-thru focused)

When you pay $227K rent on $980K revenue, margins compress. When traffic drops, fixed costs become anchors.

Franchisee returns:

Pizza Hut:
• Investment: $777K-$2M
• Profit: $147K/year
• ROI: 10-15%

Taco Bell:
• Investment: $611K-$3.98M
• Profit: $300K-$550K/year
• ROI: 20-25%

When one concept delivers double the returns, investor behavior changes.

Taco Bell: 80%+ franchisee renewal rates.
Pizza Hut: NPC International (1,200 stores) bankrupt in 2020. Eduardo Diaz's portfolio lost 90% value.

No rational investor opens Pizza Hut when Taco Bell offers better returns.

Competitive positioning compounds this:
• Domino's owns speed ($9B vs $5.4B)
• Little Caesars owns value
• Papa John's owns quality perception

Pizza Hut wins on nothing.

Management tried fixing it. 2019: $130M transformation—renovations, digital platforms, menu innovation. Digital sales hit $7B (45% of total). Menu drove Q1 2023 comps up 8%.

Q3 2024:
• Pizza Hut comps: -1%
• Taco Bell comps: +4%

Digital and menu innovation don't fix 23% occupancy costs when competitors run at 4.5%.

Taco Bell fulfills orders in 5-7 minutes. Pizza Hut needs 8-10+ minutes. Lower transaction velocity = lower revenue per labor hour.

Converting 6,500 sq ft dine-in to delivery-only doesn't reduce rent—it makes occupancy worse when dine-in revenue disappears.

The solution: close legacy boxes, build smaller formats. But that requires writing off lease obligations and convincing franchisees to invest in 10-15% returns.

NPC's 2020 bankruptcy proved even large franchisees can't make the old model work.

Q3 2024: Pizza Hut (6,775 stores, -1% comps, 10-15% ROI) vs Taco Bell (8,757 stores, +4% comps, 20-25% ROI).

Once returns drop to low teens, systems struggle to attract quality operators. Growth stalls.

A 6,500 sq ft building generating $980K can't compete with a 2,500 sq ft building generating $2.2M.
