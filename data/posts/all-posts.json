When traffic drops, fixed costs become anchors.\n\nFranchisee returns:\n\nPizza Hut:\n\u2022 Investment: $777K-$2M\n\u2022 Profit: $147K/year\n\u2022 ROI: 10-15%\n\nTaco Bell:\n\u2022 Investment: $611K-$3.98M\n\u2022 Profit: $300K-$550K/year\n\u2022 ROI: 20-25%\n\nWhen one concept delivers double the returns, investor behavior changes.\n\nTaco Bell: 80%+ franchisee renewal rates.\nPizza Hut: NPC International (1,200 stores) bankrupt in 2020. Eduardo Diaz's portfolio lost 90% value.\n\nNo rational investor opens Pizza Hut when Taco Bell offers better returns.\n\nCompetitive positioning compounds this:\n\u2022 Domino's owns speed ($9B vs $5.4B)\n\u2022 Little Caesars owns value\n\u2022 Papa John's owns quality perception\n\nPizza Hut wins on nothing.\n\nManagement tried fixing it. 2019: $130M transformation\u2014renovations, digital platforms, menu innovation. Digital sales hit $7B (45% of total). Menu drove Q1 2023 comps up 8%.\n\nQ3 2024:\n\u2022 Pizza Hut comps: -1%\n\u2022 Taco Bell comps: +4%\n\nDigital and menu innovation don't fix 23% occupancy costs when competitors run at 4.5%.\n\nTaco Bell fulfills orders in 5-7 minutes. Pizza Hut needs 8-10+ minutes. Lower transaction velocity = lower revenue per labor hour.\n\nConverting 6,500 sq ft dine-in to delivery-only doesn't reduce rent\u2014it makes occupancy worse when dine-in revenue disappears.\n\nThe solution: close legacy boxes, build smaller formats. But that requires writing off lease obligations and convincing franchisees to invest in 10-15% returns.\n\nNPC's 2020 bankruptcy proved even large franchisees can't make the old model work.\n\nQ3 2024: Pizza Hut (6,775 stores, -1% comps, 10-15% ROI) vs Taco Bell (8,757 stores, +4% comps, 20-25% ROI).\n\nOnce returns drop to low teens, systems struggle to attract quality operators. Growth stalls.\n\nA 6,500 sq ft building generating $980K can't compete with a 2,500 sq ft building generating $2.2M.",

It's about choosing the bigger pile of cash.\n\nChipotle generates $2.1B in operating cash flow. Capex for new stores: $594M (304 stores in 2024). Free cash flow: $1.5B.\n\nThey generate enough cash to self-fund 300+ stores per year and return $1.5B to shareholders.\n\nFranchising is a financing tool for capital-constrained businesses.

Standardized supply chain (three suppliers control the market), existing fryers in every store, 30-day rollout vs. 6-12 months for real innovation. Minimal capex, zero kitchen reconfiguration.\n\nTaco Bell: Already growing (+9% Q1). Value positioning, 4:16 drive-thru times, 60% digital mix.

Strips stabilized momentum without operational risk.\n\nWendy's: Q1 -2.8% \u2192 Q2 -3.6% \u2192 Q3 -4.7%. Accelerating decline. Premium positioning in a value market, slower service than competitors, losing breakfast share. Strips don't fix brand positioning, service speed, or value perception.\n\nWendy's typical store does $2.2M annually with 15.6% margins (Q3 2025). Fixed costs (rent, labor, utilities) = 50-60% of revenue. When traffic drops 4.7%, those costs don't flex spreading them over less revenue accelerates losses.\n\nCan strips fix this? Strip pricing ($6-8, ~30% food cost) = $4-5 contribution margin. Offsetting lost revenue requires 35-50 extra strip orders daily (5-7% of transactions).\n\nCustomers substitute (strips instead of burgers) rather than add. No incremental revenue. Menu additions fail because customers aren't spending more and new items don't bring people in.\n\nMenu innovation works when you have traffic momentum. Taco Bell adds strips for growing customers. Wendy's adds them to mask declining traffic, slower service, and eroded value perception.\n\nChains add menu complexity when operational excellence is too hard or too slow to fix. It's not strategy: it's the cheapest move when harder changes (labor model, kitchen redesign, brand repositioning) take years.\n\nTaco Bell's strips are a growth accelerator. Wendy's are a band-aid.

It's from how fixed costs scale at high revenue levels.\n\nAverage check: $45 per person. With average parties of 3.5 people, that's $158 per table.\n\nOperating 7 days a week with extended hours through late-night service.\n\nWhat $27.4 million actually requires:\n\n$75,000 in revenue. Every single day.\n\n$75,000 \u00f7 $158 = 475 parties daily. Or roughly 1,660 individual covers.\n\nTo hit that number, you need 6-7 full table turns across lunch, dinner, and late-night service. Not just on weekends. Every day.\n\nThis is where fixed costs matter:\n\nTake rent. A prime Times Square location costs roughly $2 million annually.\n\nAt $27.4M revenue: rent is 7.3% of revenue.\nAt $15M revenue: rent becomes 13.3% of revenue.\n\nSame rent payment. But it consumes nearly double the revenue as a percentage.\n\nThis pattern repeats across every fixed cost: utilities, insurance, management overhead. Higher revenue spreads these costs over a larger base. Each dollar of fixed cost becomes proportionally cheaper per sale.\n\nThat's fixed cost leverage.\n\nBut revenue doesn't equal profit:\n\nRestaurant-level operating margin (industry estimates): 12-15%\n\nAt $27.4M, Din Tai Fung generates ~$3.3-4.1M profit per location.\n\nWhy margins stay at 12-15% despite massive revenue: hand-folded dumplings and full-service dining eat into margins that drive-thru or counter-service models can preserve.\n\nThe fragility of high-volume models:\n\nAt 475 parties per day, fixed costs sit at 10-12% of revenue. The model prints money.\n\nDrop to 300 parties per day a 37% decline in traffic and those same fixed costs jump to 16-19% of revenue. Margins compress toward zero.\n\nThe rent doesn't change. The utilities don't change. The insurance doesn't change. But revenue drops, so fixed costs become a larger percentage of what's left.\n\nLarge footprints in prime locations mean fixed costs don't flex down when volume drops. You either run at capacity and win, or run at 60% and bleed.\n\nDin Tai Fung built a model that's incredibly profitable when busy and fragile when it's not. Fixed costs are a weapon when you have volume.",

They pay for everything, take all operating risk. Dunkin just collects the check.\n\nCost to Dunkin to collect that $76K? Almost nothing. That royalty stream has a ~90% profit margin.\n\nScale across 9,850 locations: hundreds of millions in high-margin revenue. No real estate risk, no labor, no capital required.\n\nThe trade-off? Speed.\n\nTest a new menu item? Regional meetings, pilot programs, legal approvals. 3-6 months minimum.\n\nFranchisees own their stores and optimize for their P&L, not your brand strategy. Manager quits (55% turnover)? Sales drop 13-17%. That's the franchisee's problem.\n\nThe franchise model turns restaurants into a royalty-collection business. High margin, low control, slow iteration.\n\nDutch Bros chose the opposite trade-off.\n\nWhen you own the stores, you control the feedback loop.\n\nTest a new drink at 50 shops. Roll it out to all 670 company stores in 2-4 weeks. No approvals. No negotiations.\n\nManager turnover drops to 35% because you're hiring for yourself, not franchisees who cut corners.\n\nEvery operational improvement compounds immediately. New training program? All stores next week. Better scheduling? Deployed in days.\n\nThe cost? You fund everything. Your EBITDA margin is 16% instead of 90%. Your ROIC is 5.07% instead of 30%+. You grow to 982 locations instead of 9,850.\n\nBut your improvement cycles are 10x faster.\n\nFranchising compounds financial returns. High margins, no capital, exponential unit growth.\n\nOperating compounds operational returns. Every improvement feeds back immediately.

Here's how different chains are handling it.\n\nIn Q2 2025, the cracks are showing. Chipotle's same-store sales dropped -4%. Cava fell to 2.1% growth, down from 21% earlier in the year. Sweetgreen declined -7.6%.\n\nAll three generate similar revenue per location:\n\u2022 Cava: $2.9 million annually\n\u2022 Sweetgreen: $2.8 million annually\n\u2022 Chipotle: $3.2 million annually\n\nSame volume. Different survival rates.\n\nThe difference shows up in operating efficiency.\n\nRestaurant-level operating margins (Q2 2025):\n\u2022 Chipotle: 27.4%\n\u2022 Cava: 26.3%\n\u2022 Sweetgreen: 18.9%\n\nThat 7.4-point margin gap between Cava and Sweetgreen on similar revenue is everything. Both are fast-casual chains selling $16-24 bowls to similar customer demographics. Both face the same cost pressures. But Cava extracts $74,000 more profit per million dollars of revenue.\n\nAt their respective volumes, that's roughly $215,000 more profit per Cava restaurant annually. Across 398 Cava locations versus 260 Sweetgreen locations, the difference compounds.\n\nWhere it shows up:\n\nOccupancy costs as percentage of revenue (Q2 2025):\n\u2022 Chipotle: ~5.0%\n\u2022 Cava: 6.8%\n\u2022 Sweetgreen: 8.9%\n\nOccupancy includes rent, utilities, and related expenses. The 2.1-point gap between Cava and Sweetgreen reflects a combination of real-estate strategy (urban vs suburban mix, unit size, drive-thru capability) and operational leverage in extracting revenue from each square foot.\n\nAt $2.9 million annual revenue, a 2.1-point occupancy cost difference equals roughly $61,000 per location annually.\n\nLabor costs (Q2 2025):\n\u2022 Chipotle: 24.7%\n\u2022 Cava: 25.0%\n\u2022 Sweetgreen: 27.5%\n\nFood, beverage & packaging costs (Q2 2025):\n\u2022 Chipotle: 28.9%\n\u2022 Cava: 29.4%\n\u2022 Sweetgreen: 27%\n\nThese cost structure differences compound at scale. The 7.4-point margin gap translates to roughly $207,000 less profit per Sweetgreen location annually compared to Cava.\n\nWhen same-store sales growth turns negative, these gaps matter. A 2% decline in traffic at Cava's margins is survivable. At Sweetgreen's margins, it's a crisis.\n\nThe chart shows everyone declining. But declining from 26.3% margins versus 18.9% margins determines who survives the next 12 months.",

A higher upfront cost became acceptable when the annual returns grew even faster.\n\nHere's how they increased sales per location without owning the stores:\n\n\u2022 Marketing: Forced franchisees to contribute 5.3% of sales to an advertising fund (up from 4% in 2019). More ads = more customers.\n\n\u2022 Digital ordering: Built the app and website. By 2020, 60% of orders were digital. Franchisees didn't build the tech but got the sales.\n\n\u2022 Real estate: Shifted from urban dine-in to suburban drive-thru. Lower rent, higher takeout volume.\n\n\u2022 Supply chain: With 2,000+ locations, Wingstop negotiated discounts with suppliers and collected rebates ($17.7M in 2023). Pure profit.\n\n\u2022 Menu: Wings, fries, sides. Simple menu = lower labor costs = higher margins for franchisees.\n\nBetween 2019-2021, over 90% of new locations were opened by franchisees who already owned Wingstops. If the economics didn't work, they wouldn't expand.\n\nWingstop added 1,339 franchised locations from 2015-2024. They only added 31 company-owned stores. They let franchisees take the risk of opening stores while collecting guaranteed 6% royalties on every dollar sold.",

Then McDonald's accelerated: 32% increase from 2019 to 2025, pushing the Big Mac from $4.39 to $5.79. This pricing velocity shift triggered the first sustained traffic decline in over a decade.\n\nThe Breaking Point:\n\n2019-2023: McDonald's raised prices steadily while maintaining 39.91% operating margins. Traffic held stable despite 20%+ annual hikes. Management repeatedly cited \"pricing power\" in earnings calls.\n\nQ2 2024 marked the inflection point. Same-store sales turned negative (-1.0%) for the first time in 13 quarters. By Q1 2025, the decline accelerated to -3.6%, the worst performance since the pandemic. US traffic fell -2.6% year-over-year.\n\nThe recovery attempts in Q2-Q3 2025 (+2.5% same-store sales) came through value menu initiatives, yet traffic remains below pre-price-hike levels.\n\nThe Franchisee Crisis:\n\nWhile corporate maintained pristine margins, the franchise system absorbed the shock. 30% of franchisees are now insolvent (Nomura Group, 2024). Operator cash flow down 10% from pandemic highs. Total system debt ballooned from $15B to $55.86B. The disconnect between corporate profitability and franchise viability widened to unsustainable levels.\n\nEvery major chain raised prices. Burger King increased 12.3%. Wendy's eliminated value offerings. Taco Bell doubled some items. Yet McDonald's suffers disproportionately. The difference? McDonald's built its empire on accessibility. Premium chains can justify premium pricing. McDonald's cannot escape its value positioning.\n\nThe core miscalculation: Management confused pandemic-era pricing tolerance with permanent pricing power. The 15-year data reveals the pattern, a decade of disciplined 1-2% annual increases from 2010-2019, then a dramatic acceleration post-pandemic. This pricing velocity shift destroyed the value perception McDonald's spent decades building.\n\nThe QSR sector demonstrates that pricing power remains context-dependent. McDonald's Q2-Q3 2025 recovery attempts through value initiatives show modest same-store sales gains, yet the fundamental challenge persists: rebuilding trust after breaking the value equation that defined the brand for decades.",

    "text": "Despite inflation concerns, Americans are spending 53% of their food budget on restaurants, revealing a fundamental shift in how we value time and convenience.\n\nFrom 1997 to 2023, Americans shifted 12 percentage points of their food spending from groceries to dining out from 41% to 53%. That shift pushed the restaurant industry to a record $1.1 trillion this year.\n\nThis trend accelerated during one of the most challenging periods for restaurants in decades.\n\nFrom 2021-2024, customer visits dropped 10-20% from pre-pandemic levels. Menu prices soared 5.9% at quick-serve restaurants and 7.1% at full-service establishments. Supply chain disruptions and labor costs squeezed margins everywhere.\n\nCooking at home costs $4.31 per meal while dining out costs about 48% more. Restaurant price inflation (3.6%) is running double grocery inflation (1.8%) in 2024.\n\nYet Americans continue choosing restaurants over home cooking for rational economic reasons.\n\nTwo-earner households, now 49.6% of married couples, spend $3,228 annually on dining out versus $2,664 for single-income families. When both partners work, time becomes more valuable than money.\n\nAmericans spend 53 minutes per day preparing food at home. For dual-income families earning $75,000+ annually, that hour represents $36+ in opportunity cost. Restaurants aren't just selling food, they're selling back valuable time.",

So why the massive gap?\n\nChipotle didn't just build a better burrito. They built a better business.\n\nHere's what Chipotle figured out that others missed:\n\n1. Premium positioning works - Strong brand allows higher pricing without losing customers\n\nChipotle charges 20-30% more per item than competitors. Their \"Food with Integrity\" positioning lets them command premium prices while maintaining customer loyalty.\n\n2. Control beats scale - Corporate ownership creates consistent quality that drives repeat customers\n\nUnlike Qdoba's franchise model, Chipotle owns all 3,800 stores directly. This ensures consistent quality and experience that builds customer trust and frequency.\n\n3. Digital-first strategy - 35.4% digital sales creates larger orders and repeat customers\u00a0 \n\nDigital customers order 20% more per transaction and return more frequently. Chipotle's app and online ordering captured 35.4% of sales vs industry standard ~20%: Qdoba.\n\n4. Technology investment pays - Back-of-house improvements create faster service and higher throughput\n\nFaster service = more customers served per hour = higher revenue per store. Chipotle's kitchen technology and throughput optimization strategies maximize transactions per day.\n\nMeanwhile, Qdoba lacks kitchen efficiency technology, requiring more manual prep work and longer service times that limit daily transaction volume.\n\nThe results speak for themselves:\n\nChipotle:\n- Revenue growth: $5.98B \u2192 $11.31B (2020-2024)\n- Nearly 3,800 locations\n- 188% above industry average profitability\n\nQdoba:\n- Total revenue: $370 million (2024)\n- 750+ locations\u00a0\u00a0\n- Relatively flat growth",

    "text": "Cocktails have a 70% profit margin while food only has a 10% margin. Here's how Gen Z's drinking habits are about to change the shape of restaurants.\n\nIndustry financial data reveals significant margin vulnerability across hospitality segments.\n\nRevenue Dependency:\nAlcohol represents 21% of full-service restaurant revenue, meaning restaurants have diversified income streams unlike bars that rely heavily on drink sales. Casual dining captures 53.2% of U.S. spirits volume, making this segment particularly exposed to consumption shifts. Premium cocktails generate the highest margins across all segments, with bars depending on these high-margin sales for profitability.\n\nGen Z's Real Impact:\nGen Z consumes 20% less alcohol per capita than older generations. According to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, annual alcohol expenditure by generation shows: Boomers ($25.09B), Generation X ($23.45B), Millennials ($23.14B), and Gen Z ($3.13B). But 73% still consume alcohol regularly.\n\nWhy This Matters by Business Model:\n\nSports bars and alcohol-focused venues face higher risk because their entire model depends on high-margin drink sales.\n\nRestaurants are more adaptable. Alcohol is only 21% of their revenue, so they can pivot to premium non-alcoholic options, craft mocktails, and functional beverages.\n\nThe Adaptation:\nRestaurant chains are successfully capitalizing on this trend. According to industry data, 33% of Gen Z consumers have purchased mocktails at restaurants, higher than any other generation. Premium non-alcoholic drinks often have similar margins to alcohol (75-80%) and appeal to Gen Z's wellness preferences, with 41% citing \"to be healthier\" as their reason for choosing non-alcoholic options.\n\nThe hospitality businesses winning aren't the ones selling the most alcohol. They're the ones understanding how each generation wants to spend their money.",

    "text": "In order to grow a restaurant chain quickly you need a shit ton of capital. And restaurant chains use this hack called sale leasebacks to unlock that capital. \n\nMost restaurants are sitting on a goldmine: their real estate. The smartest operators are turning that real estate into capital without losing control of their business. \n\nA sale leaseback is when a restaurant sells its owned real estate to an investor, then immediately leases it back under a long-term agreement. That unlocks cash while letting the restaurant keep operating in the same location.\n\nHow are some recent examples of groups using this to grow:\n\n\ud83c\udf54 Meritage Hospitality (2nd-largest Wendy\u2019s franchisee) sold 48 stores in 2020\u201321 for $109M, using the proceeds to build new units and pay down credit lines.\n\n\ud83c\udf55 Papa John\u2019s (2024) sold two commissary kitchens for $46.7M with 17-year triple-net leases and 2.75% annual rent bumps. That plugged a $27M cash shortfall and booked a $41M gain.\n\n\ud83c\udf57 Yummy Inc. (a large Yum! Brands franchisee) recapitalized 20 Taco Bell & KFC units this way, stabilizing operations and funding growth within a year.\n\n\ud83c\udf5f Red Robin sold 28 sites for ~$73M in 2023\u201324 to Essential Properties Realty Trust, cutting debt by $49M in one year.\n\nWhy investors love QSR (quick-service restaurant) real estate:\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 E-commerce resistant \u2013 You can\u2019t \u201cAmazon\u201d a burger. Even during the pandemic, drive-thru and takeout kept revenue flowing and rent paid. Compare that with malls and shopping real-estate that\u2019s been hammered as consumers buy entirely online\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Triple-net stability \u2013 Tenants pay property taxes, utilities, insurance, and common area fees. Landlords collect rent (often with 1\u20132% annual bumps) without worrying about other costs\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Creditworthy tenants \u2013 Corporate-guaranteed McDonald\u2019s and Chick-fil-A sites have sold at 4.0\u20134.5% cap rates. That\u2019s seen as lower risk than a mom-and-pop shop that could miss rent payments\n\nThe bottom line: Sale-leasebacks let operators fund expansion, remodels, acquisitions, or debt reduction - often at a lower effective cost of capital than borrowing. They turn real estate into a strategic asset without losing operational control.",

Hippy Potter), inspired by the viral Pop Mart Labubu collectibles.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\nFour characters\u00a0 --\u00a0 \u201cPeter Chip,\u201d \u201cGarlic Gus,\u201d \u201cJimmy Harissa,\u201d and \u201cSweet Sammy.\u201d\nBlind box model\u00a0 --\u00a0 you won\u2019t know which you get until you open the meal.\nLimited run\u00a0 --\u00a0 only available in-restaurant, for a short time.\nEach plush comes on a keyring, perfect for attaching to a bag and showing off online.\n\nThe entire campaign is designed to capitalize on the massive Labubu trend of collectible, wearable toys, only a few months after the trend started on social media.\n\nWhy Labubu matters:\n\n\ud83c\udf0f Originated with Pop Mart (Beijing toy company), gaining global fame after K-pop star Lisa (Blackpink) was seen with one in April 2024.\u00a0\u00a0\n\ud83c\udfb6 Endorsed by Rihanna, Cher, and others.\u00a0\u00a0\n\ud83d\udca5 Sold out so quickly they crashed Pop Mart\u2019s website and caused store fights in the UK.\u00a0\u00a0\n\ud83e\uddf8 Positioned between toys and fashion -- like Jellycat (if you don\u2019t know ask someone under the age of 25), but with an edgy \u201cugly-cute\u201d vibe.\u00a0\u00a0\n\ud83d\udcc8 Even counterfeit \u201cLafufu\u201d versions are gaining attention in this booming market.\n\nHere\u2019s where this has happened before.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s collectibles prove this model works:\nTeenie Beanie Babies (1997\u20132000)\u00a0 --\u00a0 Some rare singles now fetch thousands; complete sets sell for $800+.\nFurby Toy Sets (1990s)\u00a0 --\u00a0 Full sets have sold for ~$1,000.\n101 Dalmatians Collector Box Set\u00a0 --\u00a0 Worth $50\u2013$380 today.\nMighty Morphin Power Rangers Set\u00a0 --\u00a0 Up to $120 for a full set.\n\nIn fact, you could argue that Furby was the Labubu of the 90's!\n\nThis is a good strategy for CAVA.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 FOMO drives foot traffic\u00a0 --\u00a0 The blind-box format makes repeat visits more likely (\u201cgotta collect them all\u201d).\u00a0\u00a0\n\ud83d\udcac Social amplification\u00a0 --\u00a0 Building on cultural cachet instead of having to manufacture their own\u00a0\u00a0\n\ud83c\udf81 Emotional connection\u00a0 --\u00a0 The plushies become a tangible, lasting reminder of the brand\n\nThere is one difference here:\n\nMcDonalds and others often licensed the actual toy / brand.\n\nIt looks like CAVA didn\u2019t want the overhead and instead decided to roll out their own line of toys\n\nThe upside is it\u2019s likely faster and CAVA has full creative control. The downside is that consumers might not care as much as they do about \u201cauthentic\u201d Labubus.\n\nOpportunities for brands to be relevant are scarce\n\nIt will be interesting to see how this strategy performs for CAVA.",

Placer.ai data echoes the trend: statewide McD foot-traffic flipped from slightly above the U.S. average to -2.5 pp below after April 1.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Automation is filling the gap (slowly).\n- White Castle still plans ~100 Flippy fry robots (\u2248 \u2153 of its system), but SEC filings show only 13 units live across White Castle and Jack in the Box today. The newest model installs in hours, ~75 % faster than the prior generation.\n- Kiosks are scaling faster than robots: Jack in the Box has added self-order kiosks to 1,500 stores, and a 180-unit Burger King/Popeyes franchisee is retrofitting every location within 60 days.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Schedules are slimming down.\n- An Orange-County Wendy\u2019s cut day-shift crews from \u2248 11 to 7 workers.\n- Employment Policies Institute survey: 89 % of California operators have trimmed hours and 98% have raised prices since April.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 The price gap keeps widening.\nLimited-service menu inflation in California (13.1%) is almost double the national rate (7.2%), nudging some diners toward groceries or full-service restaurants.\n\nBottom line: The $20 wage hasn\u2019t collapsed the industry, but it\u2019s forcing radical re-thinks in pricing, staffing, and automation \u2013 moves happening sooner and harder than anywhere else.

Even with an accounting background, they couldn't make the numbers add up.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nHere's the truth: Many vendors deliberately make it hard to see the full financial picture. They bury fees. Obscure costs. Create confusion.\n\nThis hits restaurants hardest.\n\nYou're running on razor-thin margins already. As my customer said, \"it's a pennies game.\" When you can't track every penny going to vendors, those pennies turn into thousands before you notice.\n\nI've seen it happen. $25K gone because of hidden fees. $2.3M in unnecessary vendor costs over three years.\n\nNot because restaurant owners are careless. But because the system is designed to keep you in the dark.\n\nThe solution?\n\n1. Partner only with vendors who provide complete financial transparency\n2. Implement systems that show every transaction clearly\n3. Walk away from any vendor who makes it difficult to access your own financial data\n\nIn 2023, financial transparency isn't a luxury. It's a necessity.\n\nDon't let vendors hide your money from you.\n\nBtw, at Superorder, we built our platform specifically to give restaurant owners full visibility into every transaction.
