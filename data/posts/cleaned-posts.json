Here’s the thing franchise owners miss.\n\nChick-fil-A keeps tight control:  \n- Fewer stores (2,500 vs. Subway’s 20,000)\n- Mandatory owner-operators (no absentee owners) – if you own it, you’re in the restaurant   \n- Prospective owners must have been Chick‑fil‑A managers\n- Real estate & build-out controlled by franchisor: They own the property and equipment, leasing it to you  –  giving them full scope over site, design and brand consistency\n\nSubway’s model? \n- Subway actively recruits owners to hold multi locations – often 25+ units. This encourages passive investors who can oversee many units rather than deeply engage with individual restaurants.\n- Franchisees lease and renovate their own real estate and choose their layouts—unlike Chick‑fil‑A’s full franchisor-controlled build-out.\n- Oversaturation → cannibalization: Subway’s Average Unit Volume increased until 2013, then dropped sharply likely because stores placed too close to existing franchises were cannibalizing sales\n\nThe result?\nSubway’s revenue peaked in 2013 and never recovered.\nChick-fil-a’s revenue has more than DOUBLED in the same period.",

Annually: $772K per location.\n\nWhat $5.36 buys:\n• Larger portions than competitors\n• 58% responsibly-sourced ingredients vs industry average of ~20%\n• Fresh produce delivered daily, no freezers in stores\n• Real cooking: chicken is grilled in-house, not pre-cooked\n• Transparent supply chain customers can verify\n\nHow volume makes it work:\n\nFixed costs dilute. The same occupancy cost spread over 480 transactions vs 200 transactions changes everything. Labor per transaction drops from $7 during slow hours to $2.50 during peak. Ingredient cost stays flat at $5.36 regardless of volume.\n\nDuring lunch rush, their fastest restaurants hit 350 orders per hour, nearly 6 customers per minute. At that throughput, fixed costs become negligible.\n\nThis requires operational infrastructure that took years to build:\n• 350 orders/hour peak capacity (vs industry average of 100-120)\n• Digital ordering driving 35% of sales creating a second make-line\n• Chipotlane locations generating 15% higher volume\n• Supply chain that can handle fresh daily deliveries at scale\n\nCompetitors can't just \"spend more on ingredients\" and win. They need the volume first, which requires brand strength, digital infrastructure, and operational excellence that takes years to develop.",

    "text": "Fast-casual bowl chains are all dealing with the same pressures right now. Consumer spending down, food costs up, labor expensive. Here's how different chains are handling it.\n\nIn Q2 2025, the cracks are showing. Chipotle's same-store sales dropped -4%. Cava fell to 2.1% growth, down from 21% earlier in the year. Sweetgreen declined -7.6%.\n\nAll three generate similar revenue per location:\n• Cava: $2.9 million annually\n• Sweetgreen: $2.8 million annually\n• Chipotle: $3.2 million annually\n\nSame volume. Different survival rates.\n\nThe difference shows up in operating efficiency.\n\nRestaurant-level operating margins (Q2 2025):\n• Chipotle: 27.4%\n• Cava: 26.3%\n• Sweetgreen: 18.9%\n\nThat 7.4-point margin gap between Cava and Sweetgreen on similar revenue is everything. Both are fast-casual chains selling $16-24 bowls to similar customer demographics. Both face the same cost pressures. But Cava extracts $74,000 more profit per million dollars of revenue.\n\nAt their respective volumes, that's roughly $215,000 more profit per Cava restaurant annually. Across 398 Cava locations versus 260 Sweetgreen locations, the difference compounds.\n\nWhere it shows up:\n\nOccupancy costs as percentage of revenue (Q2 2025):\n• Chipotle: ~5.0%\n• Cava: 6.8%\n• Sweetgreen: 8.9%\n\nOccupancy includes rent, utilities, and related expenses. The 2.1-point gap between Cava and Sweetgreen reflects a combination of real-estate strategy (urban vs suburban mix, unit size, drive-thru capability) and operational leverage in extracting revenue from each square foot.\n\nAt $2.9 million annual revenue, a 2.1-point occupancy cost difference equals roughly $61,000 per location annually.\n\nLabor costs (Q2 2025):\n• Chipotle: 24.7%\n• Cava: 25.0%\n• Sweetgreen: 27.5%\n\nFood, beverage & packaging costs (Q2 2025):\n• Chipotle: 28.9%\n• Cava: 29.4%\n• Sweetgreen: 27%\n\nThese cost structure differences compound at scale. The 7.4-point margin gap translates to roughly $207,000 less profit per Sweetgreen location annually compared to Cava.\n\nWhen same-store sales growth turns negative, these gaps matter. A 2% decline in traffic at Cava's margins is survivable. At Sweetgreen's margins, it's a crisis.\n\nThe chart shows everyone declining. But declining from 26.3% margins versus 18.9% margins determines who survives the next 12 months.",

However, leverage is supported by strong EBITDA and cash flow.

When offices reopened, we decided to try staying remote for about a year since the team had gotten comfortable around it. \n\nI learned that communication gaps are almost impossible to fully close when you’re building a startup remotely. \n\nIn-person, you turn to your teammate, hash something out in two minutes, and move forward. Remotely, that same problem becomes a 30-minute scheduled call, or worse, a Slack thread that drags for days. \n\nThe casual interactions also create culture. Shared meals, jokes, whiteboard sessions - that’s where people actually buy into the mission. When you’re remote, you can onboard someone and run team calls, but it’s harder for them to feel what the company is about. \n\nAnd at minimum - the core team has to be in person. In the early days, it’s not optional. That’s when every conversation matters. Maybe some non-exec roles can be remote here and there, but the preference should still be in-person.\n\nYes, a handful of companies like Zapier have made remote work.

    "text": "In the 1960s, McDonald’s first non-burger menu item (Filet-O-Fish) went head-to-head with a grilled pineapple sandwich - and the story only gets weirder from there.\n\n📉 In the early 1960s, Cincinnati McDonald’s franchisee Lou Groen faced a crisis. A massive portion of his Monfort Heights customers were Catholic, and every Friday during Lent, they abstained from meat (except fish). Sales were down.\n\nGroen noticed a nearby Frisch’s Big Boy selling plenty of fish sandwiches. So he made his own and pitched it to McDonald’s founder Ray Kroc.\n\nKroc’s reaction?  “Hell no” Kroc said he didn’t care if the Pope himself showed up, he could eat a burger just like everyone else.\n\n🍍 But Groen persisted and Kroc agreed – on one condition. The Filet-O-Fish would face off against his own meatless creation: the Hula Burger, a grilled pineapple-and-cheese sandwich.\n\nThe showdown was set for Good Friday, 1962. The winner stays on the menu.\nGroen crushed it – selling 350 Filet-O-Fish sandwiches that day and only 6 Hula burgers\n\nThe “fish that catches people” went from a Friday-only offering to a daily menu item, then regional, national, and global. It was the first non-burger on McDonald’s original menu – joining other franchisee inventions like the Big Mac, Egg McMuffin, and apple pie.\n\nFor Groen, it was life-changing. After losing his home and nearly going broke, he rebuilt from scratch – turning one struggling store into  40+ McDonald’s locations!\n\n🚀 Today, McDonald’s sells 300 million Filet-O-Fish sandwiches a year. Nearly every major fast-food chain now runs special Lent menus: Wendy’s, Arby’s, KFC, Jack in the Box,Carl’s Jr., Taco Bell, and more.\n\nThe Filet-O-Fish also changed McDonald’s corporate DNA – forcing it to consider the diversity of American markets. A blue polystyrene clamshell Filet-O-Fish box sits in the National Museum of American History.\n\nKroc famously quipped to two Catholic executives: “Now that we’ve invested in all this equipment to handle fish, the pope will change the rules.”",

A higher upfront cost became acceptable when the annual returns grew even faster.\n\nHere's how they increased sales per location without owning the stores:\n\n• Marketing: Forced franchisees to contribute 5.3% of sales to an advertising fund (up from 4% in 2019). More ads = more customers.\n\n• Digital ordering: Built the app and website. By 2020, 60% of orders were digital. Franchisees didn't build the tech but got the sales.\n\n• Real estate: Shifted from urban dine-in to suburban drive-thru. Lower rent, higher takeout volume.\n\n• Supply chain: With 2,000+ locations, Wingstop negotiated discounts with suppliers and collected rebates ($17.7M in 2023). Pure profit.\n\n• Menu: Wings, fries, sides. Simple menu = lower labor costs = higher margins for franchisees.\n\nBetween 2019-2021, over 90% of new locations were opened by franchisees who already owned Wingstops. If the economics didn't work, they wouldn't expand.\n\nWingstop added 1,339 franchised locations from 2015-2024. They only added 31 company-owned stores. They let franchisees take the risk of opening stores while collecting guaranteed 6% royalties on every dollar sold.",

Contaminated produce likely lettuce or tomatoes spread bacteria through Chipotle locations from Washington to Ohio. 55 customers fell ill. 21 ended up in hospitals. The CDC launched a criminal investigation that would last years.\n\nStock price: $750 → $400 (47% crash)\nMarket cap: $14.67 billion → $7.2 billion (lost more than their annual revenue)\nSame-store sales: -23.4% by Q1 2016\nRevenue: Down 13.3% year-over-year\n\nOne in four customers stopped coming. 43 locations shut down. Wall Street analysts declared the brand permanently damaged.\n\nInstead of damage control, they hired Mansour Samadpour, the food safety expert who'd revolutionized testing protocols at Costco and Jack in the Box. His audit revealed uncomfortable truths about their \"fresh food\" supply chain.\n\nThey implemented DNA-based testing on every ingredient. Not random samples. Every batch. Over 100 tests per ingredient before it reached stores.\n\nThey started blanching onions in boiling water. Marinating chicken in sealed bags. Testing lettuce at three different points. Changes that horrified their \"fresh is everything\" culture.\n\nThe losses continued. Q3 2016: same-store sales still down -21.9%. \n\nDecember 2016:\n\nSame-store sales jumped +14.7%. The first positive number in 14 months. Customers were returning.\n\nMcDonald's quietly adopted Chipotle's enhanced produce washing protocols. Qdoba implemented DNA testing. Subway overhauled their handling procedures. Panera launched nationwide safety training programs.\n\nBy 2023, Chipotle hit $9.9 billion in revenue, 2.5x their crisis low. The same analysts who predicted their demise now studied their comeback.\n\nThe $25 million criminal fine they paid in 2020? A rounding error compared to the $8 billion in shareholder value they'd rebuilt.\n\nChipotle didn't just fix their food safety problem. They set a standard so high that the entire industry had to follow. Their biggest failure became their moat.",

Restaurants deserve solutions that:\n- Eliminate real operational headaches — from third-party profitability to messy review management.\n- Deliver results without extra complexity — plug-and-play integrations across delivery platforms.\n- Win back customers, revenue, and time — turning guest feedback into loyalty and reorders.\n\nThe problems are real, and restaurants are ready for better answers.\n\nAnd beyond the conference halls, we carved out time as a team - dinners, late-night brainstorms, and plenty of laughs. These moments matter. They strengthen how we work together and remind us that building Superorder is as much about people as it is about product.\n\nOh, and we’re also running a raffle for a trip to Hawaii (Maui is unreal this time of year 🌺). \n\nJust fill out the form and book a demo with us to enter:\nhttps://lnkd.in/dS29rucx",

    "text": "5% (1 in 20) of all fast food restaurants in the US now run on Superorder. And we did it in just 18 months. \n\nHere’s the story behind how we got here.\n\n1. Listening to the Operators\n\nEarly on, I found myself talking to restaurant operators who were struggling with their marketing and finances. Their teams were focused on running the kitchen smoothly but back office marketing and ops were slipping through the cracks.\n\nWe spent countless hours with operators to understand what parts of the stack we could take on and build for to make their lives easier. We scribbled down what they needed, and those notes shaped our product. That trust we built led to signing a 500+ unit brand just months later.\n\n2. Showing Up Where It Counts\n\nWe showed up to our first trade show with no booth. We walked the floor for 8 hours straight. One conversation led to another and we booked demos with multiple large restaurant groups. \n\nOne late-night dinner with a franchise owner sparked a chain-wide pilot. That pilot grew, and word-of-mouth took off. By the end of our first year, we were in 2,000+ locations.\n\n3. Moving Fast\n\nOne of our clients wanted to onboard few hundred locations within 48 hours - they desperately needed to automate some finance workflows. The deal was big and if we didn't onboard them within 48 hours we would lose the deal.\n\nOur engineers and onboarding team pulled consecutive all-nighters and got them live by 9 am two days later. That hustle is who we are, it’s why we can roll out new products fast and keep growing.\n\nWhat’s Next?\n\nBy the end of this year, we’re gunning to power 10% of all QSR/Fast Casual/Fast Food restaurants in the US. Want to see why so many chains trust Superorder? Book a demo with us.\n\nHere's our growth for the last 18 months, minus the x and y labels. You get the idea (:",

He saw them as more important than anything else on the menu because they symbolized what the brand stood for: quality, consistency, and reliability.\n\nHe treated fry preparation like a \"sacred ritual.\" When fries didn't meet his standards, bland, mushy, inconsistent he considered it a failure. He'd reject entire batches and demand his suppliers start over.\n\nThat obsession led to something no competitor has been able to replicate: an end-to-end system that processes 3.4 billion pounds of potatoes annually.\n\nHere's what makes it work:\n\n• Potato sourcing: McDonald's only uses Russet Burbank potatoes from ~100 suppliers worldwide. Each supplier goes through a rigorous approval process for size, shape, texture, and storability.\n\n• The double-fry method: Fries are par-fried at 335°F for exactly 3 minutes and 10 seconds at the supplier level, then flash-frozen to lock in texture. In stores, they're fried again at the same precise temperature and time.\n\n• Scale and precision: Every step from blanching (12-25 minutes) to coating with potato starch to shaking the basket 3-4 times during frying is standardized across 40,000+ locations.\n\nThe result? They've mastered consistency at scale. 3.6 billion servings a year across 40,000+ locations, zero variation.\n\nMcDonald's has spent 60+ years optimizing supplier relationships, proprietary equipment, and logistics networks. Their vertical integration and economies of scale create cost advantages that competitors simply can't replicate.\n\nFive Guys, Shake Shack, In-N-Out: they all make great fries. But they don't have the decades of R&D, the supplier infrastructure, or the operational scale to match McDonald's consistency.",

Fast food menu prices increased 42% from 2020-2025, with some chains up to 82%. The result?

Eater said it would \"save the hospitality industry\" and \"forever change how diners dine.\" The New York Times predicted \"nothing will ever be the same.\"\n\nBut things didn't go according to plan.\n\nServers at Maialino and Gramercy Tavern saw their pay drop $100 per week. One server at Union Square Cafe lost $10,000 annually. \n\nThe restaurant group hemorrhaged front-of-house staff. Meyer admitted they lost 40% of their servers. His chief restaurant officer said \"our strongest people have left.\"\n\nWhy? Servers could make more money with tips from competitors. \n\nMeanwhile, the business costs exploded:\n- Payroll taxes tripled at some restaurants  \n- Insurance costs increased significantly\n- Menu price resistance from customers\n- No federal tax advantages (tips get tax breaks, wages don't)\n\nIn 2020, he reversed the policy during the pandemic, saying it was \"inhumane to tell our servers that you can't accept that expression of gratitude.\"\n\nThe experiment wasn't isolated. Nearly 90% of restaurants that tried no-tipping switched back. Some lasted only six months.\n\nThe experiment revealed 3 hard truths about tipping:\n1. Servers don't want predictable wages if it means lower total income. Tips let high performers earn more than their base wage. Take that away, and your best people leave.\n2. Diners resist paying higher menu prices even when told it eliminates tipping. A $28 entree feels expensive. A $24 entree plus a $5 tip feels normal, even though it's more money.\n3. The tax system favors tipping. Tips get federal tax breaks that wages don't. Switch to wages, and your payroll taxes can triple overnight.\n\nHis experiment proved tipping survives because it works for everyone customers, servers, and operators even when everyone admits it's flawed.",

    "text": "Din Tai Fung's flagship locations generate $27.4 million per restaurant annually.\n\nThat's not from premium pricing alone. It's from how fixed costs scale at high revenue levels.\n\nAverage check: $45 per person. With average parties of 3.5 people, that's $158 per table.\n\nOperating 7 days a week with extended hours through late-night service.\n\nWhat $27.4 million actually requires:\n\n$75,000 in revenue. Every single day.\n\n$75,000 ÷ $158 = 475 parties daily. Or roughly 1,660 individual covers.\n\nTo hit that number, you need 6-7 full table turns across lunch, dinner, and late-night service. Not just on weekends. Every day.\n\nThis is where fixed costs matter:\n\nTake rent. A prime Times Square location costs roughly $2 million annually.\n\nAt $27.4M revenue: rent is 7.3% of revenue.\nAt $15M revenue: rent becomes 13.3% of revenue.\n\nSame rent payment. But it consumes nearly double the revenue as a percentage.\n\nThis pattern repeats across every fixed cost: utilities, insurance, management overhead. Higher revenue spreads these costs over a larger base. Each dollar of fixed cost becomes proportionally cheaper per sale.\n\nThat's fixed cost leverage.\n\nBut revenue doesn't equal profit:\n\nRestaurant-level operating margin (industry estimates): 12-15%\n\nAt $27.4M, Din Tai Fung generates ~$3.3-4.1M profit per location.\n\nWhy margins stay at 12-15% despite massive revenue: hand-folded dumplings and full-service dining eat into margins that drive-thru or counter-service models can preserve.\n\nThe fragility of high-volume models:\n\nAt 475 parties per day, fixed costs sit at 10-12% of revenue. The model prints money.\n\nDrop to 300 parties per day a 37% decline in traffic and those same fixed costs jump to 16-19% of revenue. Margins compress toward zero.\n\nThe rent doesn't change. The utilities don't change. The insurance doesn't change. But revenue drops, so fixed costs become a larger percentage of what's left.\n\nLarge footprints in prime locations mean fixed costs don't flex down when volume drops. You either run at capacity and win, or run at 60% and bleed.\n\nDin Tai Fung built a model that's incredibly profitable when busy and fragile when it's not. Fixed costs are a weapon when you have volume.",

    "text": "Here's the story of how the In-N-Out founder invented the $200B+ drive-thru industry that every chain uses today. Also crazy that 70% of all fast food sales happen via drive-thrus 🤯.\n\nIt was a combination of California car culture, post-war suburbanization, and Harry Snyder tinkering in his Baldwin Park garage at night in 1948.\n\nWhen Harry Snyder opened his tiny burger stand that year, most fast food still involved getting out of your car. You'd either walk up to a counter or wait for carhops to bring food on trays.\n\nOver the previous decades, car culture had been building momentum in Southern California. Drive-in theaters were popular. The Pig Stand in Texas (1921) had carhops serving food in cars. But it was slow and labor-intensive.\n\nHarry Snyder founded In-N-Out Burger with his wife Esther, and their burger stand was tiny (10 feet wide) and focused on fresh ingredients. But the real innovation happened after hours.\n\nSnyder spent his nights in his garage engineering a two-way speaker system that would let customers order from their cars without face-to-face interaction.\n\nTwo features of 1940s California helped make this work:\n- Geography: Post-war suburban design meant restaurants needed to serve cars, not pedestrians. Wide parking lots and street access became essential.\n- Technology: Radio technology was advancing fast. Snyder could build an intercom system that actually worked reliably.\n\nFast forward to the 1950s: other chains started copying In-N-Out's system. Jack-in-the-Box added a mascot voice on their intercom. Wienerschnitzel joined in 1961.\n\nBut the real explosion came in the 1970s when McDonald's perfected the franchise model and spread drive-thrus nationwide.\n\nThe design was ideal for America's changing lifestyle. Suburbanization meant longer commutes. Two-income households meant less time for sit-down meals. Drive-thrus solved the speed problem without sacrificing convenience.\n\nFast food had always been about efficiency, but many people wanted something even faster than walking inside and waiting in line.\n\nJust pull up, order through a speaker, pay at one window, get food at another.\n\nThat little speaker system Harry Snyder built in his garage became a $200 billion industry standard.\n\ncc: Rob Howards Michael Mravle Ryan La Masa In-N-Out Burger",

So why the massive gap?\n\nChipotle didn't just build a better burrito. They built a better business.\n\nHere's what Chipotle figured out that others missed:\n\n1. Premium positioning works - Strong brand allows higher pricing without losing customers\n\nChipotle charges 20-30% more per item than competitors. Their \"Food with Integrity\" positioning lets them command premium prices while maintaining customer loyalty.\n\n2. Control beats scale - Corporate ownership creates consistent quality that drives repeat customers\n\nUnlike Qdoba's franchise model, Chipotle owns all 3,800 stores directly. This ensures consistent quality and experience that builds customer trust and frequency.\n\n3. Digital-first strategy - 35.4% digital sales creates larger orders and repeat customers  \n\nDigital customers order 20% more per transaction and return more frequently. Chipotle's app and online ordering captured 35.4% of sales vs industry standard ~20%: Qdoba.\n\n4. Technology investment pays - Back-of-house improvements create faster service and higher throughput\n\nFaster service = more customers served per hour = higher revenue per store. Chipotle's kitchen technology and throughput optimization strategies maximize transactions per day.\n\nMeanwhile, Qdoba lacks kitchen efficiency technology, requiring more manual prep work and longer service times that limit daily transaction volume.\n\nThe results speak for themselves:\n\nChipotle:\n- Revenue growth: $5.98B → $11.31B (2020-2024)\n- Nearly 3,800 locations\n- 188% above industry average profitability\n\nQdoba:\n- Total revenue: $370 million (2024)\n- 750+ locations  \n- Relatively flat growth",

    "text": "In order to grow a restaurant chain quickly you need a shit ton of capital. And restaurant chains use this hack called sale leasebacks to unlock that capital. \n\nMost restaurants are sitting on a goldmine: their real estate. The smartest operators are turning that real estate into capital without losing control of their business. \n\nA sale leaseback is when a restaurant sells its owned real estate to an investor, then immediately leases it back under a long-term agreement. That unlocks cash while letting the restaurant keep operating in the same location.\n\nHow are some recent examples of groups using this to grow:\n\n🍔 Meritage Hospitality (2nd-largest Wendy’s franchisee) sold 48 stores in 2020–21 for $109M, using the proceeds to build new units and pay down credit lines.\n\n🍕 Papa John’s (2024) sold two commissary kitchens for $46.7M with 17-year triple-net leases and 2.75% annual rent bumps. That plugged a $27M cash shortfall and booked a $41M gain.\n\n🍗 Yummy Inc. (a large Yum! Brands franchisee) recapitalized 20 Taco Bell & KFC units this way, stabilizing operations and funding growth within a year.\n\n🍟 Red Robin sold 28 sites for ~$73M in 2023–24 to Essential Properties Realty Trust, cutting debt by $49M in one year.\n\nWhy investors love QSR (quick-service restaurant) real estate:\n\n1️⃣ E-commerce resistant – You can’t “Amazon” a burger. Even during the pandemic, drive-thru and takeout kept revenue flowing and rent paid. Compare that with malls and shopping real-estate that’s been hammered as consumers buy entirely online\n\n2️⃣ Triple-net stability – Tenants pay property taxes, utilities, insurance, and common area fees. Landlords collect rent (often with 1–2% annual bumps) without worrying about other costs\n\n3️⃣ Creditworthy tenants – Corporate-guaranteed McDonald’s and Chick-fil-A sites have sold at 4.0–4.5% cap rates. That’s seen as lower risk than a mom-and-pop shop that could miss rent payments\n\nThe bottom line: Sale-leasebacks let operators fund expansion, remodels, acquisitions, or debt reduction - often at a lower effective cost of capital than borrowing. They turn real estate into a strategic asset without losing operational control.",

    "text": "Cocktails have a 70% profit margin while food only has a 10% margin. Here's how Gen Z's drinking habits are about to change the shape of restaurants.\n\nIndustry financial data reveals significant margin vulnerability across hospitality segments.\n\nRevenue Dependency:\nAlcohol represents 21% of full-service restaurant revenue, meaning restaurants have diversified income streams unlike bars that rely heavily on drink sales. Casual dining captures 53.2% of U.S. spirits volume, making this segment particularly exposed to consumption shifts. Premium cocktails generate the highest margins across all segments, with bars depending on these high-margin sales for profitability.\n\nGen Z's Real Impact:\nGen Z consumes 20% less alcohol per capita than older generations. According to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, annual alcohol expenditure by generation shows: Boomers ($25.09B), Generation X ($23.45B), Millennials ($23.14B), and Gen Z ($3.13B). But 73% still consume alcohol regularly.\n\nWhy This Matters by Business Model:\n\nSports bars and alcohol-focused venues face higher risk because their entire model depends on high-margin drink sales.\n\nRestaurants are more adaptable. Alcohol is only 21% of their revenue, so they can pivot to premium non-alcoholic options, craft mocktails, and functional beverages.\n\nThe Adaptation:\nRestaurant chains are successfully capitalizing on this trend. According to industry data, 33% of Gen Z consumers have purchased mocktails at restaurants, higher than any other generation. Premium non-alcoholic drinks often have similar margins to alcohol (75-80%) and appeal to Gen Z's wellness preferences, with 41% citing \"to be healthier\" as their reason for choosing non-alcoholic options.\n\nThe hospitality businesses winning aren't the ones selling the most alcohol. They're the ones understanding how each generation wants to spend their money.",

Big crowds. Massive exposure. Guaranteed foot traffic.\n\nBut reality hits different.\n\nHere's the problem:\n\nWhen you partner with stadium vendors like Aramark, you surrender the one thing that matters most - your people.\n\nYou hand your brand to strangers who don't live your values or understand your standards. They're trained in days, not months.\n\nThe exec I spoke with managed 30+ restaurants and saw this pattern repeatedly: Stadium locations consistently delivered subpar food and disappointing experiences.\n\nThe real damage?\n\nThose terrible stadium experiences actually stopped customers from visiting their regular locations.\n\nThat's right. The \"exposure\" actively hurt their business.\n\nHer solution was brilliant:\n\nBuild full-service restaurants near stadiums instead.\n\nThis preserves total control over quality, training, and customer experience.\n\nThe numbers backed her up. Their stadium-adjacent locations outperformed the in-stadium counters by 37% in customer satisfaction.\n\nGrowth that damages your brand isn't growth at all.",

    "text": "Why is Italian food so popular?\n\nItaly has 59 million people, smaller than Thailand, smaller than the UK. It never had a colonial empire like Britain or France. \n\nYet the global pizza market alone is worth $283 billion. That's more than the entire Japanese cuisine market ($18.9 billion) and Mexican cuisine market ($21.7 billion) combined. China's entire food industry: $587 billion, pizza alone: $283 billion. \n\nGoogle search data shows \"pizza\" dominates every other cuisine keyword globally. It's not just popular in Western markets; it's winning in China, India, and the Middle East.\n\nI think there are three reasons this happened:\n\nFirst, timing. Italian immigration (1880-1920) coincided perfectly with urbanization and the birth of the restaurant industry. When cities exploded, Italian immigrants opened restaurants with food that was easy to scale. Pizza needs flour, water, tomatoes, and cheese: ingredients you can source anywhere. Thai curry needs galangal, kaffir lime, lemongrass: none of which existed in most markets outside Southeast Asia.\n\nSecond, psychological design. Carbs, fat, and salt: the holy trinity of comfort food. It's not sophisticated enough to be intimidating, not exotic enough to be alienating. It occupies the perfect middle ground between \"interesting\" and \"safe.\"\n\nThird, franchising. Italian food wasn't spread by Italians: it was industrialized by American capitalism. Domino's, Pizza Hut, Papa John's aren't Italian companies. They're American franchises that turned Italian food into a scalable business model and distributed it through the most powerful system ever built.\n\nThe result? Italian food became the default. The thing groups order when they can't agree. The first cuisine kids eat when dining out.\n\nMost cuisines spread through cultural proximity. Italian food spread because it removed every barrier to adoption. No complex ingredients. No acquired tastes. No religious restrictions.\n\nThat's why everyone has a favorite Italian restaurant. Mine is Fire and Ice in my hometown of Kathmandu, Nepal. The New York Times named it one of \"15 of Our Readers' Favorite Pizza Places Around the World.\" Better Italian food than most places in Manhattan.",

The overall re-order rate was 38.4% for customers who received a response, compared to 32.8% for those who did not, a difference of 5.6 percentage points.\n\nBreaking this down by star rating reveals variability in impact: ⭐️\n1-star reviews: 27.0% re-order rate with response vs. 19.9% without (+7.0 pp)\n2-star: 28.0% vs. 23.0% (+4.9 pp)\n3-star: 32.2% vs. 25.8% (+6.5 pp)\n4-star: 33.7% vs. 29.6% (+4.1 pp)\n5-star: 41.4% vs. 35.7% (+5.7 pp)\n\nThe effect is more pronounced for lower-rated reviews (1-3 stars), suggesting responses may help mitigate dissatisfaction.\n\nI was able to gather some data on major brands, the differences are as follows (response vs. no response):\n🍗: 34.3% vs. 31.3% (+3.0 pp)\n🍕🛖: 31.1% vs. 28.8% (+2.3 pp)\n🌮: 43.3% vs. 38.1% (+5.3 pp)\n👩‍🦰: 49.7% vs. 40.4% (+9.2 pp)\n🍞: 41.5% vs. 37.3% (+4.2 pp)\n\nRegarding promo offers included in responses, my data indicates mixed results. Replies without promos yielded a 38.8% re-order rate, while those with promos were at 30.3%. \n\nCompared to no reply (32.8%):\n- Promos showed gains for low ratings: +5.2 pp for 1-star, +4.4 pp for 2-star, +4.6 pp for 3-star\n- But losses for higher ratings: -2.0 pp for 4-star, +2.8 pp for 5-star (though still positive overall for 5-star)\n\nAt Superorder, our Review Management AI Agent automates these responses across Google, Yelp, and 3PD platforms, personalizing tone, tagging sentiment, and surfacing recovery opportunities.

Placer.ai data echoes the trend: statewide McD foot-traffic flipped from slightly above the U.S. average to -2.5 pp below after April 1.\n\n2️⃣ Automation is filling the gap (slowly).\n- White Castle still plans ~100 Flippy fry robots (≈ ⅓ of its system), but SEC filings show only 13 units live across White Castle and Jack in the Box today. The newest model installs in hours, ~75 % faster than the prior generation.\n- Kiosks are scaling faster than robots: Jack in the Box has added self-order kiosks to 1,500 stores, and a 180-unit Burger King/Popeyes franchisee is retrofitting every location within 60 days.\n\n3️⃣ Schedules are slimming down.\n- An Orange-County Wendy’s cut day-shift crews from ≈ 11 to 7 workers.\n- Employment Policies Institute survey: 89 % of California operators have trimmed hours and 98% have raised prices since April.\n\n4️⃣ The price gap keeps widening.\nLimited-service menu inflation in California (13.1%) is almost double the national rate (7.2%), nudging some diners toward groceries or full-service restaurants.\n\nBottom line: The $20 wage hasn’t collapsed the industry, but it’s forcing radical re-thinks in pricing, staffing, and automation – moves happening sooner and harder than anywhere else. Every brand CFO and every state legislature now has a front-row seat to California’s experiment.",

February 2022: NBC Bay Area exposed users selling fake reviews for $25-$50 each. Yelp's 2023 Trust & Safety Report confirmed 28,800+ reviews removed for violations. App Store rating: 4.5 stars.\n\nMeanwhile consumer behavior shifted underneath them. 74% of diners started discovering restaurants via social media instead of review platforms. 88% now rely on peer recommendations over anonymous reviews. Trust in crowd-sourced platforms declining while authenticated networks surged.\n\nBeli launched in 2021 with a different structure. Authenticated social network where every recommendation ties to a real person you follow. No anonymous reviews. No ads. Dish-level recommendations instead of just restaurants. Users follow friends, chefs, food critics they trust. Social accountability made fake reviews structurally impossible.\n\nBeli's numbers: $12M raised from Goodwater Capital, FirstMark, and G9 Ventures. 30M users in 3 years. 4.9 stars on App Store.\n\nYelp spent billions on moderation trying to police fake reviews. Beli removed the incentive to create them by removing anonymity.\n\nYelp optimized for scale and monetization. Beli optimized for trust and recommendations.",

Hippy Potter), inspired by the viral Pop Mart Labubu collectibles.\n\nHere’s how it works:\nFour characters  --  “Peter Chip,” “Garlic Gus,” “Jimmy Harissa,” and “Sweet Sammy.”\nBlind box model  --  you won’t know which you get until you open the meal.\nLimited run  --  only available in-restaurant, for a short time.\nEach plush comes on a keyring, perfect for attaching to a bag and showing off online.\n\nThe entire campaign is designed to capitalize on the massive Labubu trend of collectible, wearable toys, only a few months after the trend started on social media.\n\nWhy Labubu matters:\n\n🌏 Originated with Pop Mart (Beijing toy company), gaining global fame after K-pop star Lisa (Blackpink) was seen with one in April 2024.  \n🎶 Endorsed by Rihanna, Cher, and others.  \n💥 Sold out so quickly they crashed Pop Mart’s website and caused store fights in the UK.  \n🧸 Positioned between toys and fashion -- like Jellycat (if you don’t know ask someone under the age of 25), but with an edgy “ugly-cute” vibe.  \n📈 Even counterfeit “Lafufu” versions are gaining attention in this booming market.\n\nHere’s where this has happened before.\n\nMcDonald’s collectibles prove this model works:\nTeenie Beanie Babies (1997–2000)  --  Some rare singles now fetch thousands; complete sets sell for $800+.\nFurby Toy Sets (1990s)  --  Full sets have sold for ~$1,000.\n101 Dalmatians Collector Box Set  --  Worth $50–$380 today.\nMighty Morphin Power Rangers Set  --  Up to $120 for a full set.\n\nIn fact, you could argue that Furby was the Labubu of the 90's!\n\nThis is a good strategy for CAVA.\n\n📈 FOMO drives foot traffic  --  The blind-box format makes repeat visits more likely (“gotta collect them all”).  \n💬 Social amplification  --  Building on cultural cachet instead of having to manufacture their own  \n🎁 Emotional connection  --  The plushies become a tangible, lasting reminder of the brand\n\nThere is one difference here:\n\nMcDonalds and others often licensed the actual toy / brand.\n\nIt looks like CAVA didn’t want the overhead and instead decided to roll out their own line of toys\n\nThe upside is it’s likely faster and CAVA has full creative control. The downside is that consumers might not care as much as they do about “authentic” Labubus.\n\nOpportunities for brands to be relevant are scarce\n\nIt will be interesting to see how this strategy performs for CAVA.",

Even with an accounting background, they couldn't make the numbers add up.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nHere's the truth: Many vendors deliberately make it hard to see the full financial picture. They bury fees. Obscure costs. Create confusion.\n\nThis hits restaurants hardest.\n\nYou're running on razor-thin margins already. As my customer said, \"it's a pennies game.\" When you can't track every penny going to vendors, those pennies turn into thousands before you notice.\n\nI've seen it happen. $25K gone because of hidden fees. $2.3M in unnecessary vendor costs over three years.\n\nNot because restaurant owners are careless. But because the system is designed to keep you in the dark.\n\nThe solution?\n\n1. Partner only with vendors who provide complete financial transparency\n2. Implement systems that show every transaction clearly\n3. Walk away from any vendor who makes it difficult to access your own financial data\n\nIn 2023, financial transparency isn't a luxury. It's a necessity.\n\nDon't let vendors hide your money from you.\n\nBtw, at Superorder, we built our platform specifically to give restaurant owners full visibility into every transaction.

    "text": "McDonald's 32% Big Mac price increase since 2019 marks a historic acceleration, triple the rate of the previous decade.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2019, Big Mac prices crept up just 13% (from $3.90 to $4.39). Then McDonald's accelerated: 32% increase from 2019 to 2025, pushing the Big Mac from $4.39 to $5.79. This pricing velocity shift triggered the first sustained traffic decline in over a decade.\n\nThe Breaking Point:\n\n2019-2023: McDonald's raised prices steadily while maintaining 39.91% operating margins. Traffic held stable despite 20%+ annual hikes. Management repeatedly cited \"pricing power\" in earnings calls.\n\nQ2 2024 marked the inflection point. Same-store sales turned negative (-1.0%) for the first time in 13 quarters. By Q1 2025, the decline accelerated to -3.6%, the worst performance since the pandemic. US traffic fell -2.6% year-over-year.\n\nThe recovery attempts in Q2-Q3 2025 (+2.5% same-store sales) came through value menu initiatives, yet traffic remains below pre-price-hike levels.\n\nThe Franchisee Crisis:\n\nWhile corporate maintained pristine margins, the franchise system absorbed the shock. 30% of franchisees are now insolvent (Nomura Group, 2024). Operator cash flow down 10% from pandemic highs. Total system debt ballooned from $15B to $55.86B. The disconnect between corporate profitability and franchise viability widened to unsustainable levels.\n\nEvery major chain raised prices. Burger King increased 12.3%. Wendy's eliminated value offerings. Taco Bell doubled some items. Yet McDonald's suffers disproportionately. The difference? McDonald's built its empire on accessibility. Premium chains can justify premium pricing. McDonald's cannot escape its value positioning.\n\nThe core miscalculation: Management confused pandemic-era pricing tolerance with permanent pricing power. The 15-year data reveals the pattern, a decade of disciplined 1-2% annual increases from 2010-2019, then a dramatic acceleration post-pandemic. This pricing velocity shift destroyed the value perception McDonald's spent decades building.\n\nThe QSR sector demonstrates that pricing power remains context-dependent. McDonald's Q2-Q3 2025 recovery attempts through value initiatives show modest same-store sales gains, yet the fundamental challenge persists: rebuilding trust after breaking the value equation that defined the brand for decades.",

    "text": "It’s crazy that in the early 1980s, Ray Dalio worked to enable McDonald’s to sell the Chicken McNugget.\n\nIt took a bit of financial engineering from Dalio who would later go on to manage one of the world's largest hedge funds.\n\n1️⃣ In 1982, McDonald’s wanted to launch McNuggets nationwide. But there was an issue – Chicken prices swing wildly, and a spike could wipe out profits.\n\n2️⃣ Suppliers wouldn’t allow fixed prices. Chicken producers wouldn’t commit to long-term contracts because feed costs (corn & soymeal) could rise and destroy their margins.\n\n3️⃣ Enter Ray Dalio (yes, billionaire founder of the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates now managing $162B). At the time Bridgewater wasn’t even a hedge fund – it was an advisory firm based in his Manhattan apartment.\n\nDalio brought a simple piece of financial engineering from the finance world – futures contracts. Here’s how it worked:\n\n1. Today: The farmer locks in a deal to pay $3.00 per bushel of chicken feed to be delivered 6 months from now.\n\n2. Six months from now: The feed is delivered as promised under the deal\n\n3. Even if prices are higher ($4, $5, or even $10 / bushel), the farmer still only pays the $3.00 they agreed to at the start.\n\n4. The result: Their feed costs are stable, protecting them from sudden price spikes and making it easier to plan.\n\n“A chicken can be seen as a simple machine: a chick plus its feed,” Dalio recalled. “The most volatile cost the producer needed to worry about was feed prices. I showed Lane [a chicken supplier] how to use a mix of corn and soymeal futures to lock in costs so they could quote a fixed price to McDonald’s. Having greatly reduced its price risk, McDonald’s introduced the McNugget in 1983. I felt great about helping make that happen.”\n\nHere’s what that means in plain English: \n\n💰 Lane, the chicken supplier, bought futures contracts for corn at $3.00/bushel and soymeal at $250/ton.\n\n🔮 This locked in what they would pay for chicken feed months in advance, even if prices later rose to, say, $3.50/bushel and $300/ton.\n\n🍗 With feed costs guaranteed, Lane could offer McDonald’s a fixed price of, for example, $1.20 per pound of chicken.\n\n🚀 That stability let McDonald’s confidently roll out the McNugget in 1983 without worrying about sudden cost spikes.\n\n4️⃣  Using corn & soymeal futures contracts, suppliers could lock in today’s prices for future delivery.\nExample: Buy July corn futures at $3.00/bushel now — even if the market hits $3.50, your cost stays $3.00.\n\n5️⃣ With feed costs fixed, suppliers could safely offer McDonald’s a stable chicken price for the year ahead. In 1983: McNuggets launch nationwide.",

Everything was $1.\n\nBy 2013, Wendy's killed their 99-cent menu.\n\nToday, McDonald's cheapest burger is $3.49.\n\nEveryone blames labor costs and rent. They're not wrong—those did rise. But they're always rising.\n\nThe structural shift was something else.\n\nFast food is 80-90% corn derivatives.\n\nHFCS in your soda. Corn-fed beef in your burger. Corn oil in your fries.\n\nThe entire business model was built on cheap corn.\n\nWhen corn prices jumped from $3.70/bushel in 2020 to $6.94 in 2022, the dollar menu economics broke.\n\nI think there are three forces that created dollar menus, and then killed them:\n\nFirst, government intervention.\n\nThe 1973 Farm Bill paid farmers to grow corn regardless of demand. Production exploded. Yields went from stable growth to 1.9 bushels per acre per year.\n\nBy 2010, the U.S. was producing 158.1 bushels per acre.\n\nCorn got cheap. $2.17/bushel in 1973, $2.52 in 1990. Inflation-adjusted, corn was nearly free.\n\nSecond, industrial transformation.\n\nCheap corn got processed into three core inputs:\n\nCoca-Cola switched to HFCS between 1980-1984. HFCS rapidly replaced sugar in soft drinks through the 1990s.\n\nCorn-fed beef averaged $0.70/lb in the 1990s.\n\nCorn oil became the default frying oil.\n\nThe entire fast food supply chain restructured around corn.\n\nThird, the plateau.\n\nYields kept growing through 2010, but growth slowed after 2013.\n\nClimate stress accelerated the problem. In 2023, 70% of corn areas were in drought.\n\nYields aren't collapsing, but they're not exploding anymore. Demand kept growing.\n\nThe result: corn prices surged 24.82% from 2020 to 2024.\n\nEven after the 2022 spike settled, corn is still $4.20/bushel, 13.5% higher than 2020.\n\nMcDonald's launched the Dollar Menu when corn was structurally cheap. They're charging $3.49 now because corn is structurally expensive.",

Data shows traffic shifting from full-service to QSR.

    "text": "Despite inflation concerns, Americans are spending 53% of their food budget on restaurants, revealing a fundamental shift in how we value time and convenience.\n\nFrom 1997 to 2023, Americans shifted 12 percentage points of their food spending from groceries to dining out from 41% to 53%. That shift pushed the restaurant industry to a record $1.1 trillion this year.\n\nThis trend accelerated during one of the most challenging periods for restaurants in decades.\n\nFrom 2021-2024, customer visits dropped 10-20% from pre-pandemic levels. Menu prices soared 5.9% at quick-serve restaurants and 7.1% at full-service establishments. Supply chain disruptions and labor costs squeezed margins everywhere.\n\nCooking at home costs $4.31 per meal while dining out costs about 48% more. Restaurant price inflation (3.6%) is running double grocery inflation (1.8%) in 2024.\n\nYet Americans continue choosing restaurants over home cooking for rational economic reasons.\n\nTwo-earner households, now 49.6% of married couples, spend $3,228 annually on dining out versus $2,664 for single-income families. When both partners work, time becomes more valuable than money.\n\nAmericans spend 53 minutes per day preparing food at home. For dual-income families earning $75,000+ annually, that hour represents $36+ in opportunity cost. Restaurants aren't just selling food, they're selling back valuable time.",

So, he got to work\n\nIn his Santa Barbara kitchen, Herb:\n- Replaced poached eggs with fried eggs cooked in a custom Teflon ring.\n- Swapped hollandaise for American cheese.\n- Kept the classic English muffin and Canadian bacon.  \n\nRay Kroc (former McDonalds CEO) saw the item’s massive potential, and the Egg McMuffin was on the menu in 1972.\n\nToday, the Egg McMuffin is iconic. But it wouldn’t exist without two things:  \n1. An innovative franchisee who believed in tinkering\n2. A 19th-century hangover that inspired its creation",

But resilience is paying off 👇\n\nAfter a year of closures and bankruptcies, the full-service segment is stabilizing.  \n\nChains like Red Lobster, TGI Fridays, and Denny’s shut down dozens of locations. Yet, visits per location stayed flat (+0.2%).\n\nHere's what's happening across the board:\n\n📉 Quick service is down – consumers are bored of legacy brands and craving novelty (Subway shuttered 631 U.S. restaurants in 2024; KFC is testing the comeback of its classic “Twister” wraps in Nashville to reignite buzz)\n\n📈 Fast casual is up – people want healthier, diverse meals without the formality and overhead (Digital orders made up 35.4 % of Chipotle’s Q1-2025 revenue; salad-focused Chopt is on track to hit ≈100 units this year, up from 88 in 2023 — about 14 % growth)\n\n📉 Casual / full-service is down – middle-tier dining feels overpriced in an inflation-weary world (Olive Garden’s same-restaurant sales fell 2.9 % in its latest quarter despite promos; BJ’s is leaning on a $13 “Pizookie Meal Deal” value bundle to pull guests back)\n\n📈 Fine dining is up – if you’re going out less, make it count with a special experience (Tasting-menu \nprices keep climbing: Atelier Crenn now charges $410+ per person, while Restaurant Daniel’s seven-course menu sits at $295, both all-time highs for those rooms)\n\n📈 Coffee is way up – coffee shops are the new third space for work, dates, and everything in-between (Blank Street nearly doubled to 84 cafés over the past 12 months; Blue Bottle is approaching the 100-store mark worldwide and just entered Singapore with its first Southeast-Asia café)\n\nThe restaurant landscape is shifting, but the opportunity is there for operators who adapt quickly.",

Many restaurants are still checking reviews by hand across DoorDash, Uber Eats, and other platforms. Teams spend hours reading feedback, writing individual responses, and sending recovery offers to disappointed customers.\n\nIt's noble. Shows commitment. But it's broken.\n\n The GM I talked to told me half their business now comes from online orders, with customer reviews scattered across seven platforms.\n\nSeven. Different. Platforms.\n\nI asked how many hours they spent on this.\n\n\"About 20 per week.\"\n\nThat's $25K in labor annually just to manage reviews manually.\n\nWhen you're running even a few locations, you need tools that can:\n- Pull together feedback from all platforms\n- Spot common customer complaints\n- Send out targeted recovery offers\n- Keep response quality consistent\n\nI've seen restaurants lose $100K+ in revenue from bad reviews they never addressed.\n\nNot because they didn't care.\n\nBut because they didn't have systems.\n\nThe smartest restaurant operators are shifting away from manual work and using integrated smart tools - not to replace personal interaction, but to amplify impact and recover more revenue.\n\nOne client cut review management time by 70% and improved recovery response by 3x.",

    "text": "I was chatting with one of the country's largest franchisee operator groups who shared an interesting perspective about online ratings that often gets overlooked: rating expectations actually differ quite a bit depending on the type of restaurant.\n\nFor quick-service restaurants competing with chains like Bojangles and Popeyes, a 3.8-4.0 star rating keeps you in the game. But if you're running an upscale or fast-casual spot going head-to-head with successful local restaurants, you really need to hit 4.5+ stars to stay competitive.\n\nQuick-service customers care most about speed, consistency, and getting good value for their money. Meanwhile, customers at higher-end places expect an exceptional experience that justifies the higher prices.\n\nIf you're leading marketing efforts, here's what to focus on:\n1. Compare your ratings with direct competitors in your category\n2. Set achievable rating targets based on your restaurant type\n3. Create review management strategies that fit your segment\n\nWhat rating trends have you seen in your part of the restaurant industry?",
